# WordPress Plugin OpenGraph

A standardized, object-oriented foundation for building high-quality WordPress Plugins.

## Contents

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate includes the following files:

* `README.md`. The file that youâ€™re currently reading.
* A `open-graph-lu` directory that contains the source code - a fully executable WordPress plugin.

## Features

* All classes, functions, and variables are documented so that you know what you need to change.
* Add custom fields to each post types to handle opengraph metadata standards.

## Installation

The Plugin can be installed directly into your plugins folder "as-is".
